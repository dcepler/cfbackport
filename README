| Description        |
----------------------

This project aims to make at least some functions from newer versions of Adobe
ColdFusion available in older versions.  For example, SessionInvalidate() is new
to CF10 but undocumented features make it possible in at least CF8+, possibly
even CF7.

Each set of functions is wrapped within an "if" statement to make sure they
aren't loaded if the version already supports them.

----------------------
| Requirements       |
----------------------

Functions should work in at least ColdFusion 8+.  Where possible I've tried to
avoid using newer syntax or functions

If ColdFusion is patched with APSB11-04 or higher, ESAPI is available for 
Encode and Decode functions.
 
APSB11-04+ installs ESAPI 1.4.4 for CF8.0.x and ESAPI 2.0_rc10 for CF9.0.0/1
CF9.0.2 already has ESAPI 2.0_rc10 installed

----------------------
| Usage              |
----------------------

Include the file cfbackport.cfm where you'd like the functions to appear.  Keep
in mind that if you are operating within a CFC, you'll need to include them
there to make use of them.

<cfinclude template="cfbackport.cfm" />

| Unit Tests         |
----------------------

Unit tests were created with MXUnit 2.1.1

	* As written (of course) CF10 passes them all
	* CF9.0.x with APSB11-04+ - 13 success, 0 error, 1 failure
	 * Failure is due to ESAPI version difference
	* CF8.0.x with APSB11-04+ - 9 success, 1 error, 4 failure
	 * Failure and Error is due to ESAPI version difference
